# Attribution methods

Attribution methods are used in side-channel attacks (SCAs) for for interpreting DL decisions. It's mainly used for identifying leaking operations in cryptographic implementations. It was proposed by [1](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/143.pdf).

This was achieved by using several open-source tools for attribution visualization used in image processing such as:
1. [DeepExplain](https://github.com/marcoancona/DeepExplain)
2. [Innvestigate](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate)
3. [Xplique](https://github.com/deel-ai/xplique)

The above code shows an example of using [Innvestigate](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate) as a case study in the case of [ASCAD](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/ASCAD/tree/master/ATMEGA_AES_v1).
